The following chapters describe the essential concepts needed for the creation of templates
and for filling them with data to generate an output content.

However, it is also possible to jump to the :ref:`basic <tgt_auto_fill_basic_example>` or the
:ref:`advanced <tgt_auto_fill_advanced_example>` example to get a quick overview of all the
principles used in the :ref:`automatic template filling <tgt_auto_fill>`.


***************************************************************************************************
Template tags
***************************************************************************************************

Blocky uses templates containing *tags* to indicate variable parts of the template as illustrated
on a simple template string below containing the so-called *block* named ``PEOPLE`` that can
be filled with name, surname and age values of each person assigned to the *variables* ``NAME``,
``SURNAME``, and ``AGE``.

.. code-block:: text

    A list of people:
    <PEOPLE>
    - <NAME> <SURNAME>, <AGE>
    </PEOPLE>

.. important::
    
    By default, the tags have an XML-like form using the uppercase letters for names, e.g.,
    ``<TAG_NAME>`` is a tag named ``TAG_NAME``.

    The tag names in a Python filling script are automatically converted to the uppercase format
    by default, i.e., it is possible to refer to the ``<TAG_NAME>`` tag using the lowercase name
    ``tag_name`` in the script.

    This tag format and automatic uppercase conversion is used in almost all examples within this
    document. However, the tag format is :ref:`configurable <tgt_config>`, as will be described
    later.


.. _tgt_primary_tags:

Primary tags
===================================================================================================

The templates used by Blocky contain the following primary tag elements representing a variable
content:

*   **Variables** consisting of a single tag, e.g., ``<VARIABLE>`` representing a variable named
    ``VARIABLE`` that can be set to the required value using a simple string replacement.

*   **Blocks** consisting of a start-end tag pair, e.g., ``<BLOCK>content</BLOCK>`` representing a
    block named ``BLOCK`` having an internal content consisting of a simple string ``content``.
    Apart from string constants, a block can also contain *variables* and other child *blocks*.

    A block can have multiple predefined **content variations** with each variation separated by
    a special tag, which by default has a ``<^BLOCK>`` format. For example, the
    ``<BLOCK>content 1<^BLOCK>content 2<^BLOCK>content 3</BLOCK>`` defines a block with three
    variations of a content selectable by the filling script.

    The standard (non-variation) block content can be **cloned**, i.e., duplicated as many times
    as needed, and variables in each clone can be filled with different values.

.. note::
    The format of all tags is :ref:`configurable <tgt_config>`.

    The whole template is considered to be a primary *block* and its content is not marked by any
    start-end tag pair, i.e., the primary template block does not have a name.


.. _tgt_auto_tags:

Automatic tags
===================================================================================================

The template can contain special tags that are filled automatically (i.e., without any values
implicitly assigned in the filling script). These special *autotags* are described below:

*   An **alignment** autotag ``<+>``: A special tag useful for the text alignment. It automatically
    repeats the first character located right after this tag in the template until a different
    character is found. The column position of the different character is kept according to the
    template regardless of the length of a generated content located before the alignment autotag.

    Example of a template using the alignment autotag:

    .. code-block:: text

        <NAME><+>               <SURNAME>

    repeats the space character located after the ``<+>`` tag right until the beginning of a
    surname (since the character "<" is different from the repeated space character). The surname
    start column will remain the same, regardless of the length of the ``NAME`` variable value. So,
    for example, filling the template using the name-surname pairs ``John``, ``Connor`` and
    ``Thomas``, ``Anderson`` results in both surnames aligned to the same column:

    .. code-block:: text

        John                    Connor
        Thomas                  Anderson

*   A **variation** autotag in form of a ``<.>`` (dot) block with two, or optionally three
    :ref:`content variations <tgt_primary_tags>`: ``<.>standard<^.>last</.>`` or
    ``<.>standard<^.>last<^.>first</.>``. This autotag is intended to be placed inside another
    block that is cloned during the :ref:`template filling <tgt_auto_fill>`. Then the first
    clone is (optionally) set to the ``first`` content of the variation autotag, the last clone is
    automatically set to the ``last`` content, and the rest of the clones in between are set to
    the ``standard`` content.

    This autoblock can be useful, for example, for the comma-separation of variables within a
    cloned block as illustrated below where the *standard* content is set to a comma ``, ``
    and the *last* content is set to an empty string ````:

    .. code-block:: text

        <NUM_LIST><NUM><.>, <^.></.></NUM_LIST>

    Cloning the ``NUM_LIST`` block with values ``1``, ``2``, ``3``, ``4`` set to the ``NUM``
    variable in each cloned content will result in a following string (notice that the last
    value ``4`` is not followed by a comma):

    .. code-block:: text

        1, 2, 3, 4

.. note::
    The format of the automatic tags can also be customized by the
    :ref:`configuration object <tgt_config>`.

.. seealso::
    See the :ref:`code example <tgt_auto_fill_basic_example>` using both of the automatic tags.


.. _tgt_auto_fill:

***************************************************************************************************
Automatic template filling
***************************************************************************************************

The automatic template filling is the simplest way to generate a templated content. The data used
for setting the values in a template is defined by a Python dictionary with keys representing the
template :ref:`variable and block tag names <tgt_primary_tags>`.

To fill the template variables and blocks with data, it is first necessary to load the whole
template into the primary :py:class:`.Block` object. This can be done by setting a template string
text or a text file in the :py:meth:`.Block.__init__` constructor. Alternatively, the
:py:attr:`.Block.template` attribute, or the :py:meth:`.Block.load_template` method can be used.


.. _tgt_auto_fill_basic:

Basic automatic filling
===================================================================================================

The template can be filled by the :py:meth:`.Block.fill` method with the required data dictionary
provided as an argument.

The dictionary values can perform one of the operations in a list below depending on the data
type of the dictionary value:

*   **Setting a variable value** using a **basic data type** (i.e., ``int``, ``float``, ``str``,
    and ``bool``). For example, the key-value dictionary pair ``name: "John"`` sets the variable
    ``name`` to the value ``John``.

*   **Setting a block content** using a **dictionary** (i.e., ``{...}``. For example, the
    ``date: {day: 24, month: December}`` sets the ``date`` block containing two variables ``day``
    and ``month`` set to values ``24``, ``December`` respectively.

*   **Cloning blocks and setting their content** using a **list or tuple of dictionaries**. As an
    example, the ``date: [{day: 24, month: 12}, {day: 25, month: 12}]`` key-value pairt creates
    and sets two clones of a ``date`` block with the ``day`` and ``month`` variables in each block
    clone set to the values ``24``, ``12`` in the first clone and to the ``25``, ``12`` in the
    second clone.


.. _tgt_auto_fill_basic_example:

The following filling script example shows all simple concepts described above, i.e., the template
containing the :ref:`basic tags <tgt_primary_tags>` and also :ref:`automatic tags <tgt_auto_tags>`
filled using the :ref:`basic principles <tgt_auto_fill_basic>` of automatic filling. The template
is defined directly by the ``template`` string and the data to fill the template with are defined
by the ``data`` dictionary.

Advanced automatic filling
===================================================================================================

*   **Setting a block content without setting its child elements** by setting the block value to a
    **non-empty** value which can be a *non-empty string, non-zero numeric value or a boolean true*.
    As an example, the key-value pairs ``date: "anything"``, ``date: 1``, ``date: True`` all set
    the content of a block amed ``date`` into the final generated output without explicitly
    setting any of its internal values or other subblocks (it is expected that the block is either
    constant, i.e., without variables, or the variables have been already set).

*   **Setting a block content variation** by a **dictionary with an artificial variable**
    ``vari_idx`` set to a numeric or boolean value with the following meaning:

    -   A numeric value zero or higher sets the specified block variation, e.g.
        ``date: {"vari_idx": 1}`` sets the second content variation of a ``date`` block (value 0
        corresponds to the first variation).
    -   A numeric value below zero removes the block, e.g. ``date: {"vari_idx": -1}`` removes the
        ``date`` block from the generated content.
    -   A boolean ``True`` has the same effect as value zero (i.e., sets the first content
        variation) and boolean ``False`` has the same effect as negative value (i.e., removes
        the block).

*   **Removing a variable** by setting its value to an **empty string or to none**, i.e.,
    ``name: ""`` or ``name: None`` both remove the ``name`` variable from the generated content.

*   **Removing a block** by setting its value to an **empty dictionary, empty list, none, zero,
    or boolean false**, i.e., ``date: {}``, ``date: []``, ``date: None``, ``date: 0``,
    ``date: False`` all remove the ``date`` block from the generated content.
